title: Revisiting the BART Algorithm
description: Better theory can always produce better results than your hacks.
---

Over the summer I [wrote][bart] about my hackathon project, an app that
virtually swaps BART tickets in order to reduce fares. This was a purely
academic exercise, to apply some concepts I had learned from my "Advanced
Algorithms" course to a problem in the real world. I described how you could
model this problem as an (integer) linear program, and I guessed that the
problem is, in fact, totally unimodular. However I offered no proof of this, and
due to hackathon time constraints I was forced to use a slow, somewhat
half-baked greedy algorithm to solve the problem.

With this article I want to rectify some of those problems. In particular, I'll
describe what went wrong in my initial linear programming formulation and how I
have fixed it. Then, I'll describe the similarities between this problem and the
minimum cost network flow problem. Finally, I'll give actual argument that the
constraint matrix of this problem is totally unimodular, so we can feel better
about using a linear programming solver.

## Problem Definition

The Cliff's Notes version of my last article is as follows. At any given time, a
lot of people are traveling between stations on the BART train system. Normally,
each person buys a ticket for the starting and ending stations of their own
trip. However, if we look at the system as a whole, there's usually a better
(i.e. cheaper) way to buy tickets so that each station has the same number of
travelers entering and exiting that station. In magical theory world, everyone
could be assigned a ticket on entry and then a separate ticket on exit. In the
real world, this would result in lots of people swapping tickets on platforms,
or else some sort of electronic Clipper Card spoofing that's not currently
practical.

The linear programming formulation is simple. If $x_{ij}$ represents the
number of tickets purchased from station $i$ to $j$, and $s_i$ represents
the number of travelers departing from station $i$, and $t_i$ represents the
number of travelers arriving at station $j$, then we have two sets of
constraints:

$$
\sum_{j} x_{ij} = s_i \:\:\: \forall i
$$

This represents the constraint that the tickets starting at $i$ need to add up
to the number of travelers departing from $i$.

$$
\sum_{i} x_{ij} = t_j \:\:\: \forall j
$$

This represents the constraint that the tickets destined for $j$ need to add
up to the number of travelers arriving at $j$. You can combine these
constraints into the matrix form $Ax = b$ quite easily. We can define $b$ as
simply a vector containing all $s_i$ followed by all $t_i$. The vector $x$
will contain the variables $x_{ij}$ in row-major order. The matrix $A$ is
best visualized by the following table, for a simple 3-station example.

|             | 11 | 12 | 13 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 31 | 32 | 33 |
|-------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Starts at 1 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
| Starts at 2 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |
| Starts at 3 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  1 |  1 |
| Ends at 1   |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |
| Ends at 2   |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |
| Ends at 3   |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 |  0 |  1 |

The other constraints are that the $x_{ij}$ need to be positive integers. That
"integer" part makes this an integer linear program, which is much harder to
solve than a normal one, unless you happen to have a totally unimodular problem.
We'll get to that in a moment.

## Failure To Solve

In my previous article, after describing this formulation, I talked about how
the SciPy linear programming solver wasn't solving this linear program properly.
This being a hackathon, I banged my head against the keyboard a few times in
frustration, blamed anything that wasn't me, and went full Rambo, implementing
my own algorithm. This algorithm actually worked, but it was horrendously slow.

More importantly, I never really stopped to examine the flaw in my logic. An
industry-grade implementation of a classic algorithm for solving a well-known
class of optimization problems was just wrong on my input?

*Nope.  I did something wrong.*

You see, most approaches to solving a linear program expect that your
constraints are linearly independent. That is, you can't write one constraint by
summing and/or subtracting other constraints. My implementation included all 45
BART stations regardless of whether there were any travelers using those
stations. With all of those extra constraints, if I entered some small test
case, the solver would fail miserably because of linearly dependent constraints.
Admittedly, some better error messages would have been nice, but ultimately this
was my fault.

Recently I've improved my old SciPy based solver. Now it only includes in the
linear program those stations which have travelers departing or arriving. So far
I haven't encountered any problems with this corrected implementation. It
produces the same results as my previous implementation, and it runs an order of
magnitude quicker (a minute or less versus around 40 minutes). This updated
implementation can be found at the [GitHub repository][ghbart].

## Is This Just Minimum Cost Flow?

One person left a comment on my previous article saying that this problem can be
modeled as minimum cost flow. This is true, and since I also studied minimum
cost flow in my advanced algorithms class, I thought it would be fun to
demonstrate that, at least intuitively, in this article.

First, the definition of minimum cost flow. The basic idea is that you have a
directed graph which has a "source" and a "sink" node. The goal of this problem
is to send a certain amount of flow along the directed edges from the source to
the sink. However, each edge has a cost per unit of flow associated with it, as
well as a capacity (i.e. maximum amount of flow) and even potentially a minimum
required amount of flow. So the goal of the whole problem is to send the flow so
that you minimize your cost while satisfying the capacity and lower bound
constraints.

There are a lot of similarities between these two problems right off the bat. We
have a directed, fully connected graph, and we're trying to send a flow (of
travelers) through this graph. Each pair of nodes (stations) has an associated
cost. There's no theoretical upper bound to the number of people traveling
between two stations---although practically you can only fit so many people on a
train. However, the one glaring difference is that we have many "sources" and
"sinks."

We could easily take this BART problem and turn it into a Minimum Cost Flow
problem by adding two new nodes: a source and sink. All travelers entering BART
would start from the source node, and all travelers leaving BART would exit
through the sink node. There would be a zero-cost edge connecting the source to
each station, and it would have a lower bound equal to the number of travelers
entering that station. Similarly, there would be a zero-cost edge from each
station to the sink node, with a lower bound equal to the number of travelers
leaving that station.

So in a nutshell, *yes*, this problem does reduce to minimum cost flow. But, it
requires a bit of a transformation to get there.

## Total Unimodularity

As I described in my original article, when you know that the constraint matrix
of a linear program is totally unimodular, you know that you can relax the
integer constraint on the problem, since the optimal solution is guaranteed to
be integer anyway.

All minimum cost flow linear programs are totally unimodular. Our problem can be
transformed into a minimum cost flow problem. However, the linear program we
made up and the linear program we would get from the minimum cost flow version
of the problem are not the same (there are at least $2n$ more variables in the
minimum cost flow version: one for each arc between the source/sink and the
stations). So even though we know that our linear program *should* have a
totally unimodular constraint matrix, we don't have a solid argument relying
solely on the constraint matrix.

Thankfully, it's not too hard. Quoting the Wikipedia[^1] article
on [Unimodularity][un]:

> Let $A$ be a $m$ by $n$ matrix whose rows can be partitioned into two
> disjoint sets $B$ and $C$. Then, the following four conditions together
> are sufficient for $A$ to be totally unimodular:
>

>
> 3. If two non-zero entries in a column of $A$ have the same sign, then the
>    row of one is in $B$, and the other is in $C$.
>
> 4. If two non-zero entries in a column of $A$ have opposite signs, then the
>    rows of both are in $B$, or both in $C$.

Our constraint matrix satisfies this exactly!  Let's take this step by step.

1. Every column of $A$ does contain at most two non-zero entries, because each
   column appears in exactly two constraints: one for the starting station and
   one for the ending station.
2. Every entry of $A$ is either 0 or 1.
3. If we let $B$ be the set of rows corresponding to the source constraints,
   and $C$ be the set of rows corresponding to the destination constraints,
   then each pair of constraints will be assigned properly.
4. There are no opposite sign entries!

Now we can have that warm, fuzzy feeling inside telling us that we have math on
our side.

## Lessons Learned

I think there are a few things I've learned from this. Hackathons can be neat,
but they've always bothered me because of how they encourage exactly the sort of
thinking I fell victim to. With such a short time constraint between me and demo
time, I had to ditch the more theoretically sound approach to my problem in
favor of an ad-hoc algorithm I knew I could get to work in time. What's worse, I
placed the blame on the SciPy solver rather than myself, since I hadn't figured
out what I did wrong. I think everyone, starting with me, can do with a more
critical eye to their own code, and I think the hackathon mindset frequently
stands in the way of that.

That being said, I don't want to hate on hackathons too much. They are a fun way
to blow off some steam and get a chance to try that wild and crazy idea you had.

     For those who would complain about Wikipedia as a source: I followed the
     reference for this particular proof, all the way to a book which I could
     find no version of online (even through my university's online resources).
     I tracked it down in the stacks of the library and found the exact theorem
     and proof! It's pretty satisfying. You can read it too: Kuhn, H.W.; Tucker,
